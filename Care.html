        Boa Constrictor Behavior and Temperament
    </h2>
    <p>
        Boas are typically active, alert snakes. They might hiss or bite if they feel threatened, but consistent handling usually will make them tame and not so defensive. It’s important to know how to hold a boa, so it feels secure. One hand should be under its body near its head, and the other hand should be under the back half of its body. The boa might loosely wrap itself around you for added support, but it typically won’t constrict unless it feels alarmed or like it’s falling.

    <h2>
        Housing the Boa Constrictor
    </h2>
    <p>
        While baby boa constrictors can be housed in glass aquariums, larger snakes will need a custom enclosure that's either commercially purchased or constructed at home. Boa constrictors are very powerful and will escape if given the chance, so enclosures must be secure. A good enclosure size for an adult boa constrictor is around 6 to 8 feet long, 2 to 3 feet wide, and 2 to 3 feet tall. The minimum size is around 10 square feet of floor space for a single snake.

        Hide boxes are essential to make your snake feel secure. A minimum of two hides should be provided in the enclosure, one at each end of the temperature gradient. Hides can be half logs, commercial reptile caves, upside-down plastic containers with a hole cut in the side, or even cardboard boxes. Make sure they are not much larger than the snake, as a close fit will help the snake feel safe. They should be cleaned or replaced when they become soiled.
        
        A cleaned and sterilized tree branch that's heavy enough to support the snake's weight should also be provided in the enclosure. Soak it in a bleach solution, rinse it very well, and dry it thoroughly before adding it if you got it from outside. Store-bought driftwood can also be used.

    <h2>
        Heat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Boa constrictors come from tropical climates, so warm temperatures in their enclosures are essential. During the day, a temperature gradient between 82 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (28 to 32 degrees Celsius) should be maintained. Also, a basking spot of 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (32 to 35 degrees Celsius) should be provided. At night, temperatures can drop to 78 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (26 to 30 degrees Celsius).

        The temperatures in your snake's cage are critical, so accurate thermometers with measurements in several locations of the enclosure (the warm end, cool end, and basking spot) are a must. A combination of incandescent bulbs, ceramic heating elements, and heating pads can be used to maintain the temperatures. Any bulbs or heating elements in the enclosure must be shielded to prevent burns, to which snakes are quite susceptible. Hot rocks should never be used.

    <h2>
        Light
    </h2>
    <p>
        Boas generally do not need any special UV lighting. Their diet should provide them with the vitamin D that they would produce from the sun's UV rays in the wild.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Humidity
    </h2>
    <p>
        Maintain a humidity level in the enclosure of around 60 to 70 percent. Keeping a bowl of water in the enclosure can help to raise the humidity level, along with misting the area. The snake will likely climb into the water bowl for baths, so make sure it's sturdy and big enough. It should be cleaned regularly, as snakes will often defecate in the water. Shedding snakes can especially benefit from a bath to aid in the natural process.
